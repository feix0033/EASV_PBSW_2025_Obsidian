# EASV PBSW 2025 

This is my education note vault. 

- This vault uses Obsidian as the main editor.
- And use git as the VCS.

# Obsidian 

I didn't share the `.obsidian` directory, so please feel free to set up your own Obisidian.

>[!waring] 
> Please do not use other OB setting directories or remember to add your setting directory into the `.gitignore` file to avoid conflict between settings.

## VCS

I'm using the git as the VCS and use GitHub as the git registry. 

You can use the obsidian plug-in `git` to available auto commit and sync. Feel free to contribute to the main branch. 

I will not share my daily notes which are named `journals`.
So in the `.gitignore` file, the directory was been added. 
You can also add your private directory to avoid sharing on GitHub. 

For your daily notes without sharing, I would like to suggest you use the same name for your daily note directory to simply avoid adding a new directory to the `.gitignore` file.

>[!warning] Please do not remove any lines on the `.gitignore` file. 
>If you have to, make a PR or an issue.
